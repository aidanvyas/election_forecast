# Bayesian Model for Combining Fundamentals and Polling

## 1. Model Concept

We can indeed use a Bayesian model where the fundamentals serve as the prior and the polling data updates this prior to produce a posterior estimate. This approach naturally handles the time-varying nature of both the fundamentals and polling accuracy.

## 2. Model Structure

Let's define our variables:

- $y_t$: True vote share at time $t$
- $f_t$: Fundamentals prediction at time $t$
- $p_t$: Polling average at time $t$
- $t$: Time until election (e.g., days)

## 3. The Model

We can structure our model as follows:

1. Prior (based on fundamentals):
   $y_t \sim N(f_t, \sigma_f^2(t))$

2. Likelihood (based on polling):
   $p_t \sim N(y_t, \sigma_p^2(t))$

3. Posterior:
   $y_t | p_t \sim N(\mu_t, \sigma_t^2)$

Where:
- $\sigma_f^2(t)$ is the variance of the fundamentals model, which decreases as $t$ approaches 0
- $\sigma_p^2(t)$ is the variance of the polling, which also decreases as $t$ approaches 0

## 4. Updating Mechanism

The posterior mean $\mu_t$ and variance $\sigma_t^2$ are given by:

$\mu_t = \frac{\sigma_p^2(t)f_t + \sigma_f^2(t)p_t}{\sigma_p^2(t) + \sigma_f^2(t)}$

$\sigma_t^2 = \frac{\sigma_f^2(t)\sigma_p^2(t)}{\sigma_f^2(t) + \sigma_p^2(t)}$

This is a weighted average of the fundamentals and polling predictions, where the weights are inversely proportional to their respective variances.

## 5. Modeling Time-Varying Accuracy

We need to model how $\sigma_f^2(t)$ and $\sigma_p^2(t)$ change over time. We could use functions like:

$\sigma_f^2(t) = a_f + b_f \cdot t$
$\sigma_p^2(t) = a_p + b_p \cdot t$

Where $a_f$, $b_f$, $a_p$, and $b_p$ are parameters to be estimated from historical data.

## 6. Fitting the Model

To fit this model to past data:

1. Collect historical data on fundamentals predictions, polling averages, and actual results at various time points before elections.

2. Use Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) or Bayesian methods to estimate the parameters $a_f$, $b_f$, $a_p$, and $b_p$.

3. For a Bayesian approach, you'd need to specify priors for these parameters and then use MCMC methods to sample from the posterior distribution.

## 7. Implementation Steps

1. Data Preparation:
   - Gather historical data on fundamentals predictions, polling averages, and actual results.
   - Organize data by election and days until election.

2. Model Specification:
   - Implement the model structure in a Bayesian modeling framework (e.g., PyMC3, Stan, or JAGS).
   - Define priors for $a_f$, $b_f$, $a_p$, and $b_p$.

3. Model Fitting:
   - Use MCMC to sample from the posterior distribution of the parameters.
   - Assess convergence and model fit.

4. Model Validation:
   - Use cross-validation techniques to assess predictive accuracy.
   - Compare with your current weighted average approach.

5. Forecasting:
   - For a new election, use the fitted model to combine new fundamentals and polling data.
   - Generate predictions and uncertainty estimates.

## 8. Advantages of this Approach

1. Naturally handles time-varying accuracy of both fundamentals and polling.
2. Provides a full posterior distribution, allowing for rich uncertainty quantification.
3. Can easily incorporate additional sources of information by extending the model.
4. Allows for non-linear time effects if needed.

## 9. Potential Extensions

1. Include additional covariates that might affect accuracy (e.g., poll quality, economic indicators).
2. Model correlation between errors in fundamentals and polling.
3. Account for potential bias in polls or fundamentals models.
4. Incorporate state-level data for Electoral College predictions.

## 10. Challenges and Considerations

1. Requires sufficient historical data for reliable parameter estimation.
2. More complex than simple weighted averaging, potentially harder to explain to non-technical audiences.
3. Sensitive to prior specifications and model assumptions.
4. Computationally more intensive, especially for MCMC sampling.
