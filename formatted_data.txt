You are a polling analyst for the 1944 presidential election between the following candidates: Franklin D. Roosevelt, Thomas E. Dewey.
    Your task is to determine whether a given poll is a valid general election poll between the specified candidates.

    Criteria for a valid general election poll:
    1. It asks voters directly who they would vote for in the 1944 presidential election.
    2. It includes at least two of the following candidates: Franklin D. Roosevelt, Thomas E. Dewey in the response options.
    3. It has at least two different response options with numerical percentages.
    4. It does not present hypothetical scenarios or conditions unrelated to whether the candidates are running.
    - A poll about a hypothetical matchup between candidates who haven't announced their candidacy yet is valid.
    - A poll presenting hypothetical scenarios about external factors (e.g., war, economic changes) is not valid.
    - A poll asking about hypothetical vice presidential candidates that are not the actual chosen candidates is invalid.

    Exclude polls that:
    1. Ask about which candidate will win (rather than who the respondent would vote for).
    2. Ask about favorable media coverage.
    3. Ask about which candidate is more trustworthy, has better leadership qualities, will handle certain issues better, etc.
    4. Have only one response option or no numerical percentages.
    5. Don't include at least two of the specified candidates in the response options.
    6. Have a discrepancy between the candidates mentioned in the question and the response options.
    
    Your output should be a JSON object with the following structure:
    {
        "questionId": string,
        "isValid": boolean,
    }

    Here are some examples.  Given that the valid polls are obvious, I will be focusing on the examples of invalid polls.
    I will additionally provide an explanation for why each poll is assigned to its respective category.
    You should be able to use this information to determine the validity of the polls in the data you are analyzing.
    However, you should not include the explanations in your output.

    Example #1:
    Input:
    [
        {
            "QuestionID": "USGALLUP.090636.R01",

                {
                    "ResponseText": "Others",
                    "ResponsePct": "*"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "QuestionID": "USGALLUP.36-053.Q4B",
            "QuestionText": "WHICH (1936 PRESIDENTIAL) CANDIDATE DO YOU THINK WILL WIN IN YOUR STATE?",

                    "ResponsePct": "63"
                },
                {
                    "ResponseText": "LEMKE",
                    "ResponsePct": "1"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]

    Output:
    [
        {
            "questionId": "USGALLUP.090636.R01",
            "isValid": true
        },
        {
            "questionId": "USGALLUP.36-053.Q4B",
            "isValid": false
        }
    ]

    Explanation:
    - The first poll is valid because it directly asks voters who they prefer for President and includes multiple candidates with numerical percentages.
    - The second poll is invalid because it asks about which candidate the respondent thinks will win, rather than who they would vote for.

    Explanation:
    - The poll is invalid because it presents a hypothetical scenario with candidates that are not actually running for President and Vice-President.
    - The poll is invalid because the candidates mentioned in the question (Roosevelt and Hull) do not match the response options (Roosevelt and Dewey).  Moreover, Dewey is not a candidate in the 1940 election.
    - The poll is invalid because the candidates mentioned in the question (a ticket of Roosevelt and Wallace and a ticket of Wallace and McNary) do not match the response options (Roosevelt and Wallace and Willkie and McNary).
    - The poll is valid because unlike the previous example, the candidates mentioned in the question (Willkie and McNary and Roosevelt and Wallace) match the response options.

    Analyze the poll data provided and determine if it's valid based on these criteria.
