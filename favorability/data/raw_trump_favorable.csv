Panelists are recruited by randomly selecting residential addresses using a process called address-based sampling (ABS). Since nearly 3-in-10 US households do not have home Internet access, respondent households who do not have Internet access or own a computer are provided Internet service and a netbook computer to ensure that panel respondents are representative of the US adult population. Unlike opt-in panels, households are not permitted to ""self-select"" into KnowledgePanel; nor are they allowed to participate in many surveys per week."

Interviews were conducted both online using a self-administered design and by telephone using live interviewers. All interviews were conducted among participants in AmeriSpeak, a probability-based panel designed to be representative of the national US adult population run by NORC at the University of Chicago. Panel participants without Internet access were interviewed via telephone by professional interviewers under the direction of NORC. NORC¿s AmeriSpeak Panel provides a representative panel of civilian, non-institutional adults (age 18 and over) living in the United States.
45% of completed interviews are sourced from Amerispeak, and 55% of completed interviews are sourced from a panel of young adults custom built by NORC. The Young Adult sample is from a probability-based household panel that uses an address based sample from a registered voter database of the entire US. Households were selected using stratified random sampling to support over-sampling of households with African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians ages 18-30. NORC contacted sampled households by US mail and by telephone, inviting them to register and participate in public opinion surveys twice a month."
