The KnowledgePanel is a nationally representative probability sample of the US adult population. Panelists are recruited by randomly selecting residential addresses using a process called address-based sampling (ABS). Since nearly 3-in-10 US households do not have home Internet access, respondent households who do not have Internet access or own a computer are provided Internet service and a netbook computer to ensure that panel respondents are representative of the US adult population. Unlike opt-in panels, households are not permitted to ""self-select"" into KnowledgePanel; nor are they allowed to participate in many surveys per week."

Panelists are recruited by randomly selecting residential addresses using a process called address-based sampling (ABS). Since nearly 3-in-10 US households do not have home Internet access, respondent households who do not have Internet access or own a computer are provided Internet service and a netbook computer to ensure that panel respondents are representative of the US adult population. Unlike opt-in panels, households are not permitted to ""self-select"" into KnowledgePanel; nor are they allowed to participate in many surveys per week."

The poll was fielded by Ipsos using its national KnowledgePanel. The KnowledgePanel is a nationally representative probability sample of the US adult population. Panelists are recruited by randomly selecting residential addresses using a process called address-based sampling (ABS). Since nearly 3-in-10 US households do not have home Internet access, respondent households who do not have Internet access or own a computer are provided Internet service and a netbook computer to ensure that panel respondents are representative of the US adult population. Unlike opt-in panels, households are not permitted to ""self-select"" into KnowledgePanel; nor are they allowed to participate in many surveys per week."
